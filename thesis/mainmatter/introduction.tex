% Mixed Reality-Driving Simulator developed using Unity 3D-Engine 
Augmented reality has not only changed the perception of the world for the ordinary user but it has also allowed researchers to conduct studies which have not been possible before. The chair of Human Machine Communication is currently developing a mixed reality driving simulator using Unity Engine in a 3D CAVE. It can be used to facilitate studies regarding reaction of the driver in different situations on the road and development of better Head-Up Displays.
